## Future Development
I'm just one dude. PRs are welcome, and need to adhere to the coding style defined in `X.txt`.
### Gluon Philosophy
This server is to mimic the vanilla Minecraft experience in all aspects, supporting all versions and the same world generation. The only logic added that doesn't adhere to vanilla Minecraft should be performance and memory improvements OR third-party additions.
### Financial support
There isn't a way to financially support this project at this time.
