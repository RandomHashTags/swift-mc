# Gluon
## Background
The swift version of the gluon-server. (https://github.com/RandomHashTags/gluon-server)

This is a standalone server. Some features may be limited in functionality, and some features will be expanded in the future.

## Philosophy
This server is to mimic the vanilla Minecraft experience in all aspects, supporting all versions and the same world generation. The only logic added that doesn't adhere to vanilla Minecraft should be performance and memory improvements OR third-party additions.

## Contributing
Adding/improving functionality is always welcome, just make a PR. 

## Current Features
- TODO :)
