It doesn't destroy the entity in the client memory, and it doesn't add it to your inventory. The server only checks for items to be picked up after each Set Player Position (and Set Player Position And Rotation) packet sent by the client. The collector entity can be any entity; it does not have to be a player. The collected entity also can be any entity, but the Notchian server only uses this for items, experience orbs, and the different varieties of arrows.
